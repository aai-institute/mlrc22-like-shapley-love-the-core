# ML-Reproducibility-Challenge-2022

This repository contains code to reproduce the paper
[`If You Like Shapley Then Youâ€™ll Love the Core`](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16721)
for the [ML Reproducibility Challenge 2022](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2022).

# Getting Started

We use Python version 3.10 for this repository.

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. More specifically version `1.2.0`.

After installing Poetry, run the following command to create a virtual environment and install
all dependencies:

```shell
poetry install
```

You can then activate the virtual environment using:

```shell
poetry shell
```

# Experiments

We use [DVC](https://dvc.org/) to run the experiments and track their results.

To reproduce all results use:

```shell
dvc repro
```

## Feature Valuation

This experiments uses 3 small scale datasets with a number of features between
10 and 14. It uses monte carlo least core to compute feature valuations
and then computes, for a varying number of computational budgets, the percentage
of all feature coalitions that satisfy the least core constraints with respect
to the true deficit $e^{*}$ (i.e. the exact least core value).

To reproduce the results of this experiment use:

```shell
dvc repro feature-valuation
```

You can find the results under [output/feature_valuation](output/feature_valuation).

# Contributing

Make sure to install the pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pre-commit install
```
